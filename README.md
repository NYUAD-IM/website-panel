### TODO
- Skip blank values
- Add a placeholder to inform that blank values will be skipped
- Add new entry after current entry
- Remove each entry
- Move the `docs/data` folder to `public/data`
- Look into uploading images + add a disclaimer asking to upload only square images (300x300 MAX)
- Have an `index.html` at `/edit`
- Look into error handling (last route on the list)
