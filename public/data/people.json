Farrow’s work also questions the narrative of expertise; with nearly every project, he embarks on learning a new skill set in order to disrupt viewer expectations as well as his own. He holds an MA in music and an MFA in Studio Art from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and is currently a lecturer in Visual Arts and Interactive Media at NYUAD."
