# NYUAD IM Documentation

Hey there. This is an up-to-date documentation of how the NYUAD IM website works. The repo for the website is [here](https://github.com/NYUAD-IM/website) and our DIY content management systsem (modestly named *panel*) is [here](https://github.com/NYUAD-IN/website-panel)

## Data Structures

### Academics
This represents all of the classes displayed on `/academics`, whether IM requirements, electives or non-IM classes.
- `title` [`string`] :  the title of the class. if the title is `Introduction to Interactive Media`, `Communications Lab` or `Communication and Technology`, the field `Minor/Major requirement` will be appended on the webpage. If the title is `Capstone Seminar` or `Capstone Project`, the field `Major requirement` will be appended on the webpage (i.e. the title of these specific classes matter!).
- `number` [`string`] : the course numer according to the NYUAD bulleting, including the department prefix.
- `program` [`string`] : the program who offers that class (IM, VisArts, etc. The exact spelling shouldn't matter for now).
- `instructors` [`array of strings`] :  names of the instructors who are offering that class. exact spelling doesn't matter.
- `track` [`string`] : the tracks mentioned in the major proposal. Possible values are: `Computational Media`, `Physical Computing`, `Media & Design Thinking`, `Foundation`.
- `term` [`arrays of strings`] : the term during which it is offered. Possible values are: `FALL`, `JANUARY`, `SPRING`, `JUNE`.
- `year` [`number`] : the year the class was last offered.
- `currently_offered` [`boolean`] : whether the class is, well, currently offered.
- `link` [`string`] :  should be a valid URL pointing to the class website. If there is no class website, leave the string empty (`""`).
- `description.short` [`string`] : a one-line, half-page display.
- `description.long` [`string`] : a more extensive description revealed on click.
- `cross-listed` [`array of strings`] : the departments with which the class is crosslisted. Possible values are the names of the departments or `[] (empty array)` for a class that is not cross-listed.
- `tags` [`array of strings`] : points to `/gallery` and display projects based on that tag. The exact spelling of these tags is up to Miha.

#### Example
```json
{
	"title": "Communications Lab",
	"number": "IM-UH 1011",
	"program":"Interactive Media",
	"track": "Foundation",
	"instructors": ["Craig Protzel", "Pierre Depaz"],
	"terms":["FALL", "SPRING"],
	"year": 2017,
	"currently_offered": true,
	"link":"http://commlab.nyuad.im",
	"description":{
		"short": "intro to multimedia storytelling",
		"long": "very long intro"
		},
	"cross-listed": ["Computer Science", "Psychology"],
	"tags": ["commlab"]
}
```

### Workshops
This structure only concerns the Sunday Workshops. All these fields are pretty self-explanatory (I hope).
- `date.machine` [`string`]: must follow this **exact** format `YYMMDD-HHMM`.
- `date.human` [`string`]: this should be generated at runtime from the panel. No need to fill it or display it for editing.
- `tags` [`array of strings`]: can be anything.
- `links`: [`array of objects`]: must include a url and the text to be displayed.

#### Example
```json
{
	"title": "Intro to Arduino",
	"instructor": "Michael Shiloh",
	"date" {
		"machine": "180212-1800",
		"human":"Feb. 12th - 6:00pm"
		},
	"location":"IM Lab - C3-029",
	"description": "Arduino is fun and Michael knows a lot about it.",
	"tags": ["physical computing", "arduino"],
	"links": [
		{
		 "url":"https://github.com/michaelshiloh",
		 "text":"repo"
		 }
		]
}
```

---

### Opportunities
This structure is going to be dedicated to jobs, internships, grants and grad school applications.
- `category.main` [`string`] :  related to the broader category of the opportunity. Possible value are `JOBS/INTERNSHIPS`, `CALL FOR PROPOSALS`, `GRADUATE EDUCATION`.
- `category.sub` [`array of strings`] : realted to the topics of the opportunity. Exact values do not matter.
- ` connections`: [`array of objects`] : connection to the opportunity - NOT PUBLIC.

#### Example
```json
{
	"title":"Lab monitor position",
	"category":{
		"main":"JOBS/INTERNSHIPS",
		"sub": ["software development", "performance", "vr", "physical computing"]
		},
	"location": "Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",
	"url":"http://yoo.ooo/",
	"deadline": "June 6th 2018",
	"description":"do all these things on the other side of the world!",
	"connections":[
		{
		 "name":"John Doe",
		 "contact": "john@doe.com",
		 "relationship" : "friend of the program"
		}
		]
}
```

### People
This structure will populate our `/people` page, from Program Heads to Lab Monitors. The `current` attribute would be used in two ways: separating between current and past community members and only displaying current Lab Monitors (due to the sheer number of Monitors over time). Ideally, the `courses` list would point to the `/academics` page.
```json
{
	"name":"Craig Protzel",
	"position": ["program head"],
	"current": true,
	"description": {
		"short": "runs the ship",
		"long": "Craig comes from LA and has been doing editing and production work in the entertainment and teaching creative coding for a while!"
		},
	"courses": ["Communication and Technology", "Communication Lab", "Mashups: Creating with Web API", "Making Education", "Explorable Stories"],
	"website": "http://craigprotzel.com/",
	"email": "craig.protzel@nyu.edu",
	"img": "craigprotzel.png"
}
```

#### Projects
This structure will be used to populate the student gallery page. `description.short` is a one-liner, whereas `description.long` should be a paragraph describing the project, its features and the underlying concept in more detail. **Important**: images should be placed in the order you want them to appear on the page. In addition, the first image in the array will always appear as the projectâ€™s thumbnail image. Since the `tags` section is used to build the nav bar on the gallery page, tag names matter a lot. It is highly encouraged you don't write tags yourself, but rather use those generated by the Google Form used for project submissions. 

**TO CHANGE**: "authors" > "people" -- could "tech" be an array? might mess with your system.

```json
{
    "title": "My Project Title",
    "authors":["author1","author2","author3"],
    "description":{
      "short":"My one line description",
      "long":"long description(1 paragraph, max 2)"
    },
    "website":"https://www.project-website.com",
    "images":["01.png","02.png","03.png"],
    "video":"https://vimeo.com/user12345",
    "tags":{
       "course":"Intro to IM",
       "semester":"Spring 2018",
       "tech":"Physical",
       "custom":["projection mapping","workshop"]
    }
}
```
